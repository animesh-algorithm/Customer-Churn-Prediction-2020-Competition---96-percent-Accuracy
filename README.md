# Customer-Churn-Prediction-2020-Competition---96-Accuracy
This competition was about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning". My Machine Learning model was 96.3% accurate in predicting the customer churn. I have followed the complete lifecycle of data science project - Data Collection(from kaggle), Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Model Building, Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation.
